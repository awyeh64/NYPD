# Data Science as a Field Final Project 1: Video Presentation and Document on Github

This repo contains my NYPD Shooting Incident Data Report in the form of an R notebook as well as the resulting HTML and PDF files created from knitting the notebook in RStudio.  The requested .mp4 presentation proved to be too large to upload to the repo and thus will be uploaded seperately on the class site.
